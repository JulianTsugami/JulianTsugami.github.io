<small class="pico-color-indigo-950">
  My journey with programming began when I first attended a C programming class at university, and
  since then, I’ve fallen in love with it. I hadn’t planned on making it my career, but after
  reconsidering my career path during my sophomore year, I decided to pursue a career as a software
  engineer because I thought turning my passion into a job would be ideal. Up until now, I’ve mostly
  worked on the backend side of systems, and during my internship, I focused on data engineering.
  Currently, I work on backend applications.
